## Description

This gem allows you to easily rename TV episode files. Useful for mass-renaming mismatched show titles.


## Installation

```sh
$ gem install showfix
```

## Usage

The most common usage is to fix all files within the current directory. You can optionally add `--pretend` to the command if you would like to see what it will rename, without actually touching your files.

```sh
$ cd SomeTvShow
$ showfix rename
```

For detailed help, just run `showfix help` for a list of commands.

## Roadmap

* Support for multi-episode files (S01E20-E21)
* Ability to manually enter season/episode numbers for show files that are not numbered at all
